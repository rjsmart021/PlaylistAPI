Project: Playlist Management API

Author: Reggie Joseph


This application simulates a collection of playlists and the songs they store. I began this application with a comment block analyzing which data structures would be most effective for storing, adding to, and searching for songs. Ultimately, I chose a dictionary of doubly linked lists to represent each playlist, with songs as nodes.
